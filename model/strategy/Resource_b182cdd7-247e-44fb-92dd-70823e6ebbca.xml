The distinction here is that the broadcast pattern, like the migration pattern, only moves data in one direction, from the source to the destination. The broadcast pattern, unlike the migration pattern, is transactional. This means it does not execute the logic of the message processors for all items which are in scope; rather, it executes the logic only for those items that have recently changed. Think of broadcast as a sliding window that only captures those items which have field values that have changed since the last time the broadcast ran. Another major difference is in how the implementation of the pattern is designed. Migration will be tuned to handle large volumes of data and process many records in parallel and to have a graceful failure case. Broadcast patterns are optimized for processing the records as quickly as possible and being highly reliable to avoid losing critical data in transit as they are usually employed with low human oversight in mission critical applications.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Why is it valuable?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The broadcast pattern is extremely valuable when system B needs to know some information in near real time that originates or resides in system A. For example, you may want to create a real time reporting dashboard which is the destination of multiple broadcast applications where it receives updates so that you can know in real time what is going across multiple systems. You may want to immediately start fulfilment of orders that come from your CRM, online e-shop, or internal tool where the fulfilment processing system is centralized regardless of which channel the order comes from. You may want to send a notification of the temperature of your steam turbine to a monitoring system every 100 ms. You may want to broadcast to a general practitioner’s patient management system when one of their regular patients is checked into an emergency room. There are countless examples of when you want to take an important piece of information from an originating system and broadcast it to one or more receiving systems as soon as possible after the event happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*When is it useful?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The broadcast pattern’s “need” can easily be identified by the following criteria:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Does system B need to know as soon as the event happens – Yes&#xD;&#xA;* Does data need to flow from A to B automatically, without human involvement – Yes&#xD;&#xA;* Does system A need to know what happens with the object in system B – No&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first question will help you decide whether you should use the migration pattern or broadcast based on how real time the data needs to be. Anything less than approximately every hour will tend to be a broadcast pattern. However, there are always exceptions based on volumes of data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second question generally rules out “on demand” applications and in general broadcast patterns will either be initiated by a push notification or a scheduled job and hence will not have human involvement. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The last question will let you know whether you need to union the two data sets so that they are synchronized across two system, which is what we call bi-directional sync. Different needs will call for different data integration patterns, but in general broadcast the broadcast pattern is much more flexible in how you can couple the applications and we would recommend using two broadcast applications over a bi-directional sync application.
