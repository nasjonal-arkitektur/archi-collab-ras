    documentation="An organization will create and uncover valuable Metadata during the process of developing DII solutions. This Metadata should be managed and maintained to ensure proper understanding of the data in the system, and to prevent the need to rediscover it for future solutions. Reliable Metadata improves an organizationâ€™s ability to manage risks, reduce costs, and obtain more value from its data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Document the data structures of all systems involved in data integration as source, target, or staging. Include business definitions and technical definitions (structure, format, size), as well as the transformation of data between the persistent data stores. Whether data integration Metadata is stored in documents or a Metadata repository, it should not be changed without a review and approval process from both business and technical stakeholders.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most ETL tool vendors package their Metadata repositories with additional functionality that enables governance and stewardship oversight. If the Metadata repository is utilized as an operational tool, then it may even include operational Metadata about when data was copied and transformed between systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of particular importance for DII solutions is the SOA registry, which provides controlled access to an evolving catalog of information about the available services for accessing and using the data and functionality in an application.
