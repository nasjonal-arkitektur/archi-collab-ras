    documentation="Business rules are a critical subset of requirements. A business rule is a statement that defines or constrains an aspect of business processing. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. Business rules fall into one of four categories: definitions of business terms, facts relating terms to each other, constraints or action assertions, and derivations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Use business rules to support Data Integration and Interoperability at various points, to: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Assess data in potential source and target data sets&#xD;&#xA;* Direct the flow of data in the organization&#xD;&#xA;* Monitor the organizationâ€™s operational data&#xD;&#xA;* Direct when to automatically trigger events and alerts&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Master Data Management, business rules include match rules, merge rules, survivorship rules, and trust rules. For data archiving, data warehousing, and other situations where a data store is in use, the business rules also include data retention rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or business rule mining. The business analyst or data steward can extract the rules from existing documentation (like use cases, specifications, or system code), or they may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs), or both."/>
