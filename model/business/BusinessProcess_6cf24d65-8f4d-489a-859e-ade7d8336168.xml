    documentation="The flow of data in a data integration solution must be designed and documented. Data orchestration is the pattern of data flows from start to finish, including intermediate steps, required to complete the transformation and/or transaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Batch data integration orchestration will indicate the frequency of the data movement and transformation. Batch data integration is usually coded into a scheduler that triggers the start at a certain time, periodicity, or when an event occurs. The schedule may include multiple steps with dependencies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Real-time data integration orchestration is usually triggered by an event, such as new or updated data. Real-time data integration orchestration is usually more complex and implemented across multiple tools. It may not be linear in nature."/>
