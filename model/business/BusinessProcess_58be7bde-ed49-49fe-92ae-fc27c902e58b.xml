    documentation="Defining data integration requirements involves understanding the organization’s business objectives, as well as the data required and the technology initiatives proposed to meet those objectives. It is also necessary to gather any relevant laws or regulations regarding the data to be used. Some activities may need to be restricted due to the data contents, and knowing up front will prevent issues later. Requirements must also account for organizational policy on data retention and other parts of the data lifecycle. Often requirements for data retention will differ by data domain and type.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Data integration and lifecycle requirements are usually defined by business analysts, data stewards, and architects in various functions, including IT, who have a desire to get data in a certain place, in a certain format, and integrated with other data. The requirements will determine the type of DII interaction model, which then determines the technology and services necessary to fulfill the requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The process of defining requirements creates and uncovers valuable Metadata. This Metadata should be managed throughout the data lifecycle, from discovery through operations. The more complete and accurate an organization’s Metadata, the better its ability to manage the risks and costs of data integration. "/>
