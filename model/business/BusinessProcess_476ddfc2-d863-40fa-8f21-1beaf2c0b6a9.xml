New or changed data should be pushed by data producing applications to other systems (especially data hubs and enterprise data buses) either at the time of data change (event-driven) or on a periodic schedule.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Best practice is to define common message definitions (canonical model) for the various types of data in the organization and let data consumers (either applications or individuals) who have appropriate access authority subscribe to receive notification of any changes to data of interest."/>
