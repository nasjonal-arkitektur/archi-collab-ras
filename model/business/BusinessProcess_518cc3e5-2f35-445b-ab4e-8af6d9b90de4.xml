    documentation="The process of data discovery will also uncover information about how data flows through an organization. This information can be used to document high-level data lineage: how the data under analysis is acquired or created by the organization, where it moves and is changed within the organization, and how the data is used by the organization for analytics, decision-making, or event triggering. Detailed lineage can include the rules according to which data is changed, and the frequency of changes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Analysis of lineage may identify updates required to documentation of systems in use. Custom-coded ETL and other legacy data manipulation objects should be documented to ensure that the organization can analyze the impact of any changes in the data flow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The analysis process may also identify opportunities for improvements in the existing data flow. For example, finding that code can be upgraded to a simple call to a function in a tool, or can be discarded as no longer relevant. Sometimes an old tool is performing a transformation that is undone later in the process. Finding and removing these inefficiencies can greatly help with the project’s success and with an organization’s overall ability to use its data. "/>
