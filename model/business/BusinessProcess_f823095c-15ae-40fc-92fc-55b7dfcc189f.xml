    documentation="Integration or ETL data flows will usually be developed within tools specialized to manage those flows in a proprietary way. Batch data flows will be developed in a scheduler (usually the enterprise standard scheduler) that will manage the order, frequency, and dependency of executing the data integration pieces that have been developed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interoperability requirements may include developing mappings or coordination points between data stores. Some organizations use an ESB to subscribe to data that is created or changed in the organization and other applications to publish changes to data. The enterprise service bus will poll the applications constantly to see if they have any data to publish and deliver to them new or changed data for which they have subscribed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Developing real-time data integration flows involves monitoring for events that should trigger the execution of services to acquire, transform, or publish data. This is usually implemented within one or multiple proprietary technologies and is best implemented with a solution that can manage the operation across technologies."/>
