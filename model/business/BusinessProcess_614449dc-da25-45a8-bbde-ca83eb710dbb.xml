    documentation="Data integration solutions should be specified at both the enterprise level and the individual solution level (see Chapter 4). By establishing enterprise standards, the organization saves time in implementing individual solutions, because assessments and negotiations have been performed in advance of need. An enterprise approach saves money in the cost of licenses through group discounts and in the costs of operating a consistent and less complex set of solutions. Operational resources that support and back up one another can be part of a shared pool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Design a solution to meet the requirements, reusing as many of the existing Data Integration and Interoperability components as is feasible. A solution architecture indicates the techniques and technologies that will be used. It will include an inventory of the involved data structures (both persistent and transitive, existing and required), an indication of the orchestration and frequency of data flow, regulatory and security concerns and remediation, and operating concerns around backup and recovery, availability, and data archive and retention."/>
