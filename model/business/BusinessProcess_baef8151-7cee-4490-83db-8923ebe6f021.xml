    documentation="Developing complex event processing solutions requires:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Preparation of the historical data about an individual, organization, product, or market and pre-population of the predictive models&#xD;&#xA;* Processing the real-time data stream to fully populate the predictive model and identify meaningful events (opportunities or threats)&#xD;&#xA;* Executing the triggered action in response to the prediction&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Preparation and pre-processing of the historical data needed in the predictive model may be performed in nightly batch processes or in near real-time. Usually some of the predictive model can be populated in advance of the triggering event, such as identifying what products are usually bought together in preparation of suggesting an additional item for purchase.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some processing flows trigger a response to every event in the real-time stream, such as adding an item to a shopping cart; other processing flows attempt to identify particularly meaningful events that trigger action, such as a suspected fraudulent charge attempt on a credit card.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The response to the identification of a meaningful event may be as simple as a warning being sent out or as complex as the automatic deployment of armed forces.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
