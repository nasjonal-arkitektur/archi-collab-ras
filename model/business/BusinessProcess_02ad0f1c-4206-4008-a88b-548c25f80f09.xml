    documentation="Data needs to be moved when new applications are implemented or when applications are retired or merged. This process involves transformation of data to the format of the receiving application. Almost all application development projects involve some data migration, even if all that is involved is the population of Reference Data. Migration is not quite a one-time process, as it needs to be executed for testing phases as well as final implementation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Data migration projects are frequently under-estimated or under-designed, because programmers are told to simply move the data; they do not engage in the analysis and design activities required for data integration. When data is migrated without proper analysis, it often looks different from the data that came in through the normal processing. Or the migrated data may not work with the application as anticipated. Profiling data of core operational applications will usually highlight data that has been migrated from one or more generations of previous operational systems and does not meet the standards of the data that enters the data set through the current application code."/>
