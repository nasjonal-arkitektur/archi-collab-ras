    documentation="Data discovery should be performed prior to design. The goal of data discovery is to identify potential sources of data for the data integration effort. Discovery will identify where data might be acquired and where it might be integrated. The process combines a technical search, using tools that scan the Metadata and/or actual contents on an organizationâ€™s data sets, with subject matter expertise (i.e., interviewing people who work with the data of interest).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Discovery also includes high-level assessment of data quality, to determine whether the data is fit for the purposes of the integration initiative. This assessment requires not only reviewing existing documentation, interviewing subject matter experts, but also verifying information gathered against the actual data through data profiling or other analysis. (See Section 2.1.4.) In almost all cases, there will be discrepancies between what is believed about a data set and what is actually found to be true.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Data discovery produces or adds to an inventory of organizational data. This inventory should be maintained in a Metadata repository. Ensure this inventory is maintained as a standard part of integration efforts: add or remove data stores, document structure changes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most organizations have a need to integrate data from their internal systems. However, data integration solutions may also involve the acquisition of data from outside the organization. There is a vast and ever growing amount of valuable information available for free, or from data vendors. Data from external sources can be extremely valuable when integrated with data from within an organization. However, acquiring and integrating external data takes planning. "/>
