    documentation="Create or re-use existing integration flows to move the data. These data services should be companions to existing similar data services, but be careful to not create multiple almost-identical services, as troubleshooting and support increasingly become difficult if services proliferate. If an existing data flow can be modified to support multiple needs, it may be worthwhile to make that change instead of creating a new service.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any data exchange specification design should start with industry standards, or other exchange patterns already existing. When possible, make any changes to existing patterns generic enough to be useful to other systems; having specific exchange patterns that only relate to one exchange has the same issues as point-to-point connections.
